# Kill the Sumatran tigers to get tokens

Players can kill tigers in the forest to win the tokens as rewards just like a real life poacher, and the amount of the tokens players receive depends on their damage.&#x20;

Players can wear Sumatran tiger products to increase their damage, the more products they wear, the damage they can cause.

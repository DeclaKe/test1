# You may become the tiger!

There is a limit of up to 5000 Sumatran tigers in the forest, and a specific percentage of Sumatran tigers are generated every minute.

When the number of Sumatran tigers in the forest is less than a certain value, every once in a while, **half of the players will randomly become additional Sumatran tigers!**

**The more tiger skin products players wear, the greater the probability for them to become the tigers.**

Players who become tigers will **lose a certain percentage of the tokens they acquired after being killed.**

## Special NFT

Players can purchase some special NFTs so that the tigers they transform into have certain special abilities, such as short-term invisibility, damage reduction, shortened transformation duration, etc.

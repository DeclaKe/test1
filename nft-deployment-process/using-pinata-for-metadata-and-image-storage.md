# Using Pinata for Metadata and Image Storage

## 1.**Upload Images**

Begin by uploading your digital art or NFT images to the 'pictures' folder within Pinata. This will ensure that your files are stored securely and are ready to be linked to your NFT metadata.

## **2.Verify Image URL**

Once uploaded, confirm that each image's URL is accessible through Pinata's cloud service. This URL is critical as it links your NFT to its visual representation.

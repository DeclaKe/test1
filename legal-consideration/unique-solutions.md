## **Digital Provenance Certificates**

Issue digital certificates of provenance for each NFT to establish a clear, verifiable lineage of the artwork, enhancing the value and legal standing of the NFTs.

## **Escrow for Funds**

Utilize an escrow system to hold funds from the sale of NFTs until they are allocated to conservation efforts, ensuring transparency and trust.

## **Collaboration with Conservation Legal Experts**

Work with legal experts in wildlife conservation to ensure that all NFT activities support and do not undermine the protection of Sumatran Tigers.

## **Innovative Licensing Models**

Develop licensing models that allow for broader use of the NFTs while protecting the rights of the creators and the zoo, such as non-exclusive licenses that permit the zoo to continue using the images in other conservation-related campaigns.

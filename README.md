# What is Tiger Killer?

This innovative GameFi platform provides a dynamic and engaging environment for users to purchase NFTs of endangered animals and earn tokens through hunting.&#x20;

In this game, players need to kill Sumatran tigers to obtain tokens, but at the same time, they must pay attention to the unknown forces in the forest.

The Sumatran tiger mainly lives in the tropical rainforests within the Sumatran Islands and is the smallest of the living tiger subspecies.&#x20;

Due to human invasion and destructive exploitation of natural resources, the Sumatran tiger's habitat has been continuously reduced. There are approximately 400-500 Sumatran tigers left in the wild.

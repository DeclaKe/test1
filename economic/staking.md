# Staking

Staking in Tiger Killer is a powerful mechanism that allows users to put their TIGER tokens to work and earn additional TIGER interest.

**Stake TIGER Tokens:**

Staking involves the process of locking in a certain amount of TIGER tokens. This action signifies your commitment to holding and growing your TIGER holdings over a specific period.

**Earning TIGER Interest:**

By staking your TIGER tokens, you become eligible to earn TIGER interest. This means that you'll receive additional TIGER tokens as a reward for holding onto your existing TIGER assets.

**Duration and Interest Rates:**

The duration for which you choose to stake your TIGER tokens directly impacts the interest rates you'll receive. Specifically, staking periods of 30, 60, and 120 days correspond to Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) of 20%, 40%, and 60%, respectively.

Opting for longer staking periods offers higher APRs, providing users with an incentive to commit to holding their TIGER tokens for extended durations.

**Flexibility in Staking Durations:**

Users have the flexibility to choose the staking duration that aligns best with their preferences and investment strategy. Whether it's a short-term commitment or a longer-term approach, Tiger Killer accommodates various timeframes.

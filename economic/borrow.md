# Borrow

The borrowing feature offers a unique opportunity for users to leverage their MATIC holdings as collateral to acquire TIGER tokens.

**Using MATIC as Collateral:**

The borrowing system allows users to use their MATIC holdings as collateral. This means that users can temporarily lock in a portion of their MATIC assets to access TIGER tokens.

**Collateral Value Limit:**

Users can borrow up to a maximum of 85% of the value of the MATIC they provide as collateral. This ensures a responsible borrowing limit while allowing users to make the most of their existing assets.

**Receiving TIGER Tokens:**

Once the MATIC collateral is successfully deposited, users receive a corresponding amount of TIGER tokens in return. These tokens can be used within the Tiger Killer ecosystem for various purposes.

**Repayment with TIGER Tokens:**

To retrieve the collateralized MATIC, users are required to repay the borrowed TIGER tokens. This process essentially functions as a means of repayment. By using TIGER tokens, users can reclaim their original collateral.

The borrowing feature in Tiger Killer opens up exciting opportunities for users to leverage their existing MATIC holdings to access TIGER tokens. It's a way to make the most of your assets and actively participate in the Tiger Killer ecosystem. By utilizing this feature responsibly, users can unlock additional value and enhance their overall experience within the platform.
